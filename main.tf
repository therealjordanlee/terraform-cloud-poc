# The following configuration uses a provider which provisions [fake] resources
# to a fictitious cloud vendor called "Fake Web Services". Configuration for
# the fakewebservices provider can be found in provider.tf.
#
# After running the setup script (./scripts/setup.sh), feel free to change these
# resources and 'terraform apply' as much as you'd like! These resources are
# purely for demonstration and created in Terraform Cloud, scoped to your TFC
# user account.
#
# To review the provider and documentation for the available resources and
# schemas, see: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/fakewebservices
#
# If you're looking for the configuration for the remote backend, you can find that
# in backend.tf.
